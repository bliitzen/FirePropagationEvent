# FirePropagationEvent
This program is very simple and is completely coded in one main.cpp file. Simply click
“run” and the simulation will start! Running the simulation will generate 49 .txt data files
pertaining to the levels of fuel content, terrain slope, wind direction, and fire status. The files
should be generated into the root location of the main.cpp file.
After initializing the data for the simulation, the program will step through each loop
spreading the fire based on fire status. Fire is “Burning”, okay spread to neighbor elements. It
will then print out each iteration in the console for you to visually see each step in the fire
propagation event. “+” means it is burning, “-” means it is not burning.
